# Special Thanks to Our Contributors

Data is critically important to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate civic engagement and oversight, and promote transparency. In March 2018, as part of the Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda (PMA), the Administration established a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal focused on Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset to establish best practices for how agencies manage and use data. As part of this CAP Goal, the first ever enterprise-wide Federal Data Strategy (FDS) was developed to establish standards, interoperability, and skills consistency across agencies. To ensure the FDS was comprehensive and actionable, an interdisciplinary team of top-level leaders from multiple Federal agencies led the CAP Goal, including: 

* Kelvin Droegemeier, Director of Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President
* Karen Dunn Kelley, Deputy Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce
* Suzette Kent, Federal Chief Information Officer, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President
* Nancy Potok, Chief Statistician of the U.S., Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President
* Maria Roat, Chief Information Officer, U.S. Small Business Administration

The CAP Goal leads wanted significant input from a diverse set of stakeholders to ensure the FDS held value for a wide variety of agencies and data users. To achieve this goal, they convened the FDS development team, which included nearly 50 career staff from around the Federal Government, who developed the components of the FDS in an iterative fashion with many opportunities for feedback. The interagency team gathered ideas, examples, comments, and suggestions from Federal employees, private industry, academia, NGOs, and the public from June 2018 to August 2019. This input helped the team build a robust, integrated approach to managing and using data. The result is a multi-year strategy that will fundamentally transform how data is managed and used. This strategy will support improving public services, fuel learning and innovation in the Federal community, and increase government accountability and transparency. The CAP Goal leads would like to recognize and thank the FDS development team, whose members spent countless hours researching, listening, and synthesizing, as well as the agency and public commenters who contributed their time and expertise through 147 sets of forum remarks and 601 written comment submissions.  The FDS and first annual Action Plan could not have been created without them.
